# Task:
Setup a project using a front-end framework of your choosing that will present a clock
displaying the current time. The clock should display hours, minutes and seconds, at the
very least, but you may expand upon this if you wish, e.g., you may additionally want to
show the date. The clock should update in real-time and should use the time on the device
that is viewing the page. You should host the code on a public repo on GitHub or GitLab (or
similar).
Considerations:
- Make the clock and presentation in any format you like. This could be a digital or
analogue or whatever you can think of!
- Bonus for implementing responsive styling, to render your clock to look good on
mobile and desktop devices.
- Bonus for GitHub or GitLab pages to host your built app.
- Bonus for any unit tests
- Try not to look at the example code unless stuck.
